# Why?

When I have an idea for a project, or when a client comes to me to talk about working for them - I love to visually mock the project up in some HTML, CSS and a splash of JS. My go-to prototyping an open source toolkit full of great front-end components, which is backed with some very good documentation.

To help with this, I have some really basic needs to help me go from 0 to 100MPH:

* I need the browser to refresh automatically when I make a change to any file
* I need to use some sort of templating system as I'll want to create components - such as headers, footers etc - that can be used in several areas
* I need to use SASS for my CSS work

## Considerations

Nobody works in the same way - so my workflow might be different to yours. And you know what - thats super cool üöÄ
